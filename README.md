NestedMVP
=========

This is an example project where I'm trying out a different way of doing MVP - if you even can call it MVP. It is
a work-in-progress and I'm not yet sure in what kind of projects I'd want to use a pattern like this.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code.

## Try it out

Clone the repository to your own machine. Then run:

```
$ mvn clean jetty:run
```

Finally navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
